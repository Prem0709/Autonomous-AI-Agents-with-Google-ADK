    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",

    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

      "\n",
      "*   Ever feel like your software projects are wrestling with complexity? Imagine a team of intelligent, specialized digital workers, each tackling a piece of the puzzle, coordinating seamlessly to build something extraordinary. That's the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's about to change how you code.\n",

      "### Main Sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Breaking Down Complexity: Divide and Conquer with Agents**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Modularization on Steroids:** MAS naturally encourages breaking down large, monolithic applications into smaller, independent, and manageable agent components. This makes code easier to understand, develop, and maintain.\n",
      "*   **Specialization for Efficiency:** Each agent can be designed to excel at a specific task (e.g., data processing, UI management, network communication). This specialization leads to more efficient code and faster development cycles as developers focus on their agent's domain.\n",
      "*   **Parallel Processing Power:** Agents can operate concurrently, allowing for true parallel execution of tasks. This is a game-changer for performance-intensive applications, significantly reducing processing time and improving responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Enhanced Adaptability and Resilience: Build Software That Bounces Back**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** If one agent fails or becomes overloaded, others can potentially take over its responsibilities or the system can re-route tasks. This creates incredibly robust and fault-tolerant applications.\n",
      "*   **Learning and Evolution:** Advanced MAS can incorporate AI and machine learning, allowing agents to learn from their environment and adapt their behavior over time. Your software can evolve and improve without constant manual intervention.\n",
      "*   **Scalability on Demand:** Need to handle more users or data? Simply add more agents! MAS architectures are inherently scalable, allowing you to easily adjust resources to meet changing demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Empowering Collaboration and Intelligence: Smarter Software, Smarter Teams**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Simulating Complex Interactions:** MAS are ideal for modeling and simulating complex real-world scenarios where multiple entities interact (e.g., traffic management, financial markets, game AI).\n",
      "*   **Distributed Problem Solving:** Agents can collaborate and share information to solve problems that would be impossible for a single entity to tackle alone. This leads to more sophisticated and intelligent solutions.\n",
      "*   **Developer Synergy:** Think of agents as digital assistants for your development process itself! They can automate testing, code generation, or even help with debugging, freeing up developers for more creative and strategic work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concluding Thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Multi-Agent Systems aren't just a futuristic concept; they're a practical toolkit for building more intelligent, adaptable, and efficient software. By embracing the principles of agent-based design, software developers can unlock new levels of innovation and deliver solutions that were once the stuff of science fiction. It's time to harness the collective power of intelligent agents and elevate your development capabilities.\n",

Picture software that can dynamically reconfigure itself if an agent encounters an issue, with other agents seamlessly stepping in to maintain full functionality. This capability leads to incredibly robust and fault-tolerant applications. More advanced MAS architectures can even incorporate Artificial Intelligence, enabling agents to learn and evolve.

For thirty years, the North Star Lighthouse had been his world, its rhythmic beam cutting through the inky blackness. Tonight, however, felt different. A low hum vibrated through the stone, a sound he'd never heard before. Beneath a loose flagstone, he found it: a rolled parchment, impossibly smooth and strangely warm. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. The map wasn't ink on paper, but shimmering, ethereal light. Islands, currents, and constellations he'd never seen bloomed and faded, their glow a siren's call in the quiet tower. The sea outside churned, as if acknowledging the map’s awakening. Elias, the solitary keeper, now held the secret to a world unseen.\n",

      "1.  **Flesh out Elias's isolation and routine:** While his thirty years of solitude are mentioned, a brief detail or two about his daily life or his internal feelings about his isolation could make his character more relatable and the contrast with his newfound discovery more impactful. For example, does he yearn for connection, or is he content?\n",
      "2.  **Introduce a hint of consequence or purpose:** The glowing map is intriguing, but its significance is unclear. Adding a subtle hint about what this map might *do* or *represent*—perhaps a legend Elias once heard, or a feeling of destiny—could elevate the mystery and provide Elias with a stronger motivation beyond simple curiosity.\n",
      "3.  **Show, don't just tell, the map's allure:** Phrases like \"siren's call\" are good, but a more specific sensory detail about the map's effect on Elias could be powerful. Does the light make him feel a strange pull, a forgotten memory surface, or a physical sensation of wonder?\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-worn grooves in the wooden table, the lantern's steady pulse his only companion. Thirty years he'd kept the North Star Lighthouse, its rhythmic beam slicing through the inky blackness. Each dawn was a familiar ache of solitude, a quiet acceptance that had settled deep in his bones. He’d long ago stopped yearning for the distant shore, finding a strange solace in the predictable rhythm of the waves and the gull’s lonely cry. Tonight, however, the familiar comfort was broken. A low hum vibrated through the stone floor, a sound that prickled his skin, alien and insistent.\n",

      "\n",
      "The map wasn't ink on paper, but shimmering, ethereal light. Islands, currents, and constellations he'd never seen bloomed and faded, their glow casting dancing shadows on the ancient stone. It pulsed with a silent energy, and as Elias stared, a forgotten melody, one his grandmother used to hum about ‘stars fallen to the sea,’ surfaced in his mind. The light seemed to hum in resonance, drawing him in, not with a siren’s call, but with a profound sense of homecoming. A forgotten memory, of a locket his mother wore, depicting a swirling, unearthly constellation, flickered at the edge of his vision. The sea outside churned, not in anger, but as if in greeting to the map’s awakening. Elias, the solitary keeper, now held the secret to a world unseen, a world that felt inexplicably tied to his own.\n",
