        "### 1.1 From Predictive AI to Autonomous Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "Artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift. Traditional AI models excel at passive, discrete tasks like answering questions or generating images, but they require constant human direction. We're now moving toward **AI agents** - complete applications capable of autonomous problem-solving and task execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Distinction:**\n",
        "- **Traditional AI**: `Prompt → LLM → Text`\n",
        "- **AI Agent**: `Prompt → Agent → Think → Act → Observe → Final Answer`\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 What is an AI Agent?\n",
        "\n",
        "An AI agent combines four essential components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Model (The \"Brain\")**: Core reasoning engine (LM/foundation model) that processes information and makes decisions\n",
        "2. **Tools (The \"Hands\")**: Mechanisms connecting reasoning to the real world (APIs, functions, databases)\n",
        "3. **Orchestration Layer (The \"Nervous System\")**: Governs the operational loop, manages planning, memory, and reasoning strategies\n",
        "4. **Deployment (The \"Body and Legs\")**: Production infrastructure making the agent accessible and reliable\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 The Agentic Problem-Solving Process\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents operate on a **five-step cyclical process**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Get the Mission**: Receive a specific, high-level goal\n",
        "2. **Scan the Scene**: Gather context from available resources\n",
        "3. **Think It Through**: Devise a plan using the reasoning model\n",
        "4. **Take Action**: Execute the plan using appropriate tools\n",
        "5. **Observe and Iterate**: Analyze outcomes and repeat until goal is achieved\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: Customer Support Agent**\n",
        "\n",
        "User asks: \"Where is my order #12345?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent:\n",
        "1. Plans a multi-step strategy (find order → track shipment → report)\n",
        "2. Calls `find_order(\"12345\")` tool\n",
        "3. Observes: order found with tracking number \"ZYX987\"\n",
        "4. Calls `get_shipping_status(\"ZYX987\")` tool\n",
        "5. Observes: \"Out for Delivery\"\n",
        "6. Generates response: \"Your order #12345 is 'Out for Delivery'!\"\n",

        "\n",
        "**Level 0: Core Reasoning System**\n",
        "- LM operates in isolation with pre-trained knowledge\n",
        "- No tools, memory, or real-time data access\n",
        "- Can explain concepts but cannot access current information\n",
        "\n",
        "**Level 1: Connected Problem-Solver**\n",
        "- Connects to external tools (search APIs, databases)\n",
        "- Can retrieve real-time information\n",
        "- Example: Searching for current stock prices or weather\n",
        "\n",
        "**Level 2: Strategic Problem-Solver**\n",
        "- Plans complex, multi-step tasks\n",
        "- Employs context engineering to manage information\n",
        "- Example: Finding coffee shops midway between two locations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Level 3: Collaborative Multi-Agent System**\n",
        "- Team of specialized agents working together\n",
        "- Agents treat other agents as tools\n",
        "- Example: Project manager delegating to research, marketing, and web dev agents\n",
        "\n",
        "**Level 4: Self-Evolving System**\n",
        "- Identifies capability gaps and creates new tools/agents\n",
        "- Dynamically expands its own capabilities\n",

        "When tasks grow complex, specialized agent teams become more effective than single \"super-agents\":\n",
        "\n",

        "**Sequential Pattern**: Linear workflow where output of one agent becomes input for next\n",
